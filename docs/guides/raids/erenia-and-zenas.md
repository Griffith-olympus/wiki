# Erenia & Zenas Raid guide

## Where can I find the raid seals?

Seals can be aquired just by farming any of the hell or heaven side. They have a low drop chance of 1-2 seals per hour.
Because of this, it's recommended to first farm some hours and then go for raids.

They can also be crafted with tickets which are obtainable upon completing daily quests.
>**Paste here the link to the daily quest**

The entry of mentioned raids will be opened at **Hell's Gate 4 (Erenia)** and **Heaven's Gate 4 (Zenas)**.

## Mechanics of both Raids

### Erenia
When you enter the Erenia raid you wait until the mobs spawned. After killing them you enter the second room.
Entering the second room will display 5 altars on the minimap which you have to destroy.

After all 5 altars are gone a stone above the next portal will spawn which has to be destroyed too.

Now you're able to enter the room with Amon. You have now the choice of saving the NPC or letting him die.

Saving will grant you a buff:

### Zenas
When you enter the Zenas raid your team will be split between 2 sides. On each side you have to clear the rooms, similar to Erenia.

In second room, to move further, you have to kill Archangel Lucifer:
