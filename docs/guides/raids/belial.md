## How can I get the seals?

We have two options for obtaining the Belial raid seals:

- Daily Quest: In order to obtain this quest you will have to finish the Main Quests of act 7.1, once this is done you will go to the map **Polluted Forest**. Here we will find an NPC called <font color="#423AC8">**Asgothi**</font> who will give us a Daily Quest, it will be easy, you only need to defeat mobs which you will find in the map.

- Farming: The mobs on the all Celestial Spire floors will with a small probability drop seals on us.

## Raid Mechanics

Unlike Kirollas and Carno, Belial has a higher level of difficulty. You need to be focused as a slight oversight can lead to the death of your entire team, the Belial raid unlike the previous two is composed of up to a maximum of 20 players. The raid is composed of 2 rooms: in the first one we will find a lever ![](https://imageshack.com/i/poeMcLMPp) which will open the door to the next room, in this room we will find the main boss of this raid Demon God Belial. 
This raid is made up of 2 main mechanics, on which the survival of you and your team will depend. Two types of obelisks will appear at random and you should pay close attention to them, the obelisks are as follows:

- <a align="center"><img width= "20px" src="https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/monsters/3037.png"/></a> <b>Obelisk of Terror</b>: When these obelisks appear you will have to move away from them as they will cause a debuff which will cause you to kill your entire team if you are careless for a moment. In case you are distracted and get the debuff <b>YOUR MUST NOT HIT BELIAL FOR ANY REASON</b> as he will reflect all the damage you cause to all other players as true damage.

- <a align="center"><img width= "20px" src="https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/monsters/3042.png"/></a> <b>Obelisk of Light</b>: When these obelisks appear, unlike the terror obelisks, you will have to get close to them because after 5 seconds if you are out of range you will be reduced by 80% of your HP.

## Recommendations for the Raid

- It is recommended to go with equipment of hero level at least c25/c45 r7-r8+8+9+10.
- Options of shells like: 
	- <font color="#ccff99">S- Increased Damage to High-Level Races: x%</font>
	- <font color="#ccff99">S- Increased Overall Attack: x%</font>
	- <font color="#ffff00">B- Increased Damage to Monster Races: x%</font>
- Use the Twilight Gem III Trophy ![](https://imageshack.com/i/pnGxom6Kp) , as resistances reduction is one of the best stats for raiding/PvE (all other major Trophies of each class in tier III are viable for this raid as well).
- Useful partner would be:
	- Archangel Lucifer's Specialist Partner Card ![](https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/2697.png)
	- Mad March Hare Specialist Partner Card ![](https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/4122.png)
	- Foxy's Specialist Partner Card ![](https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/2672.png)

## Ideal Raid Group

Since the Belial is shadow element, almost any SP that is of the element of light will work in this raid, the most recommended ones are the following:

- ![](https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/2707.png)  **Avenging Angel Specialist Card** : Because this one uses the dagger it can reach very high critical damage values, being much better than the WK or Sunchaser.

- ![](https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/2706.png) **Renegade Specialist Card** . A lot of damage per second thanks to how fast he can cast his basic attacks.

- ![](https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/909.png) **Crusader Specialist Card** . Due to the fact that can accumulate large amounts of damage thanks to his Triple Charge and with the recent changes to his Holy Breath, the Crusader can drain an additional 10 resistances as well as lowering the enemy defence level by 1.

- ![](https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/2708.png) **Archmage Specialist Card** . Very good DPS and elemental damage as well as causing a debuff which will decrease the enemy's light resistances by 10.

- ![](https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/906.png) **Holy Mage Specialist Card** . Since the amount of players available in this raid is higher it is recommended to have at least 1 Holy, it can help to eliminate the debuff that the obelisks of terror throw at us as well as boosting our damage thanks to their attack blessing.
