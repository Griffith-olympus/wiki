## How can I get the seals?

We have two options for obtaining the Carno raid seals:

- Daily Quest: In order to obtain this quest you will have to finish the Main Quests of act 7.1, once this is done you will go to the map **Beast's Lair**. Here we will find an NPC called <font color="#423AC8">**Cottari**</font> who will give us a Daily Quest, it will be easy, you only need to defeat mobs which you will find in the map.

- Farming: The mobs on the Beast's Lair map will with a small probability drop seals on us.

## Raid Mechanics

Almost all Act 7 Raids are fairly easy to understand and Carno is no exception. The raid is composed of 2 rooms: in the first one we will find a lever ![](https://imageshack.com/i/poeMcLMPp) which will open the door to the next room, in this room we will find the main boss of this raid Twisted Beast King Carno. 

There are only a couple of mechanics which might stand out, Carno will cast a buff every so often which will reflect 5000 as well as giving us a debuff if we attack him while he still has his buff.

In addition to this, every 45 seconds a horde of mobs will appear and Carno will start jumping until we eliminate all the mobs in the room. 
During this time Carno receives a buff which makes him invulnerable to any type of attack.

- It is recommended to go with equipment of hero level at least c25/c45 r7-r8+8+9+10.
- Options of shells like: 
	- <font color="#ccff99">S- Increased Damage to High-Level Races: x%</font>
	- <font color="#ccff99">S- Increased Overall Attack: x%</font>
	- <font color="#ffff00">B- Increased Damage to Monster Races: x%</font>
- Use the Twilight Gem III Trophy ![](https://imageshack.com/i/pnGxom6Kp) , as resistances reduction is one of the best stats for raiding/PvE (all other major Trophies of each class in tier III are viable for this raid as well).
- Useful partner would be:
	- Archangel Lucifer's Specialist Partner Card ![](https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/2697.png)

## Ideal Raid Group

Since the Carno is shadow element, almost any SP that is of the element of light will work in this raid, the most recommended ones are the following:

- ![](https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/2707.png)  **Avenging Angel Specialist Card** : Because this one uses the dagger it can reach very high critical damage values, being much better than the WK or Sunchaser.

- ![](https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/2706.png) **Renegade Specialist Card** . A lot of damage per second thanks to how fast he can cast his basic attacks.

- ![](https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/909.png) **Crusader Specialist Card** . Due to the fact that can accumulate large amounts of damage thanks to his Triple Charge and with the recent changes to his Holy Breath, the Crusader can drain an additional 10 resistances as well as lowering the enemy defence level by 1.

- ![](https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/2708.png) **Archmage Specialist Card** . Simply put it is the best light element SP for mages, due the raid can only contain a maximum of 8 players per team it is recommended as a mage to use an Archmage as Holy buffs can be obtained from NPC.
