## How can I get the seals?
We have removed the Akashic Record item as a method of entry to the Incomplete Fernon Raid, instead we have added a seal for the raid ![](https://imageshack.com/i/pnEthVI8p), there are three ways to obtain the seals :
- **Through an achievement:**  You can get 25 seals by completing the one-time Achievement "*Elite Unknown Souls*", which can be found in the **Monsters** section, inside Act 6.2.

- **Killing mobs in the map *Unknown Land*:** All Mobs found within this map will be able to drop a Fernon Raid Seal with some chance.

- **Killing Act 6.2 Mini Bosses:** Throughout some of the maps in *Ancelloan's Will*, you may notice the Mini Bosses, and they may drop a Fernon Raid Seal with a 50% chance.

## Raid Mechanics
You can access the Temple Site at any time through a conversation with Airship Captain in Cylloan. 
But the raid portal will not be open 24/7.
10 minutes Caligor's defeat in Frozen Crown -or even if Caligor is not defeated in 1 hour-, Fernon Raid seal will appear.

Inside the raid we will find 2 rooms, the second one will open once we activate the lever in the middle of the room ![](https://imageshack.com/i/poeMcLMPp). Once we enter the room, we will meet the Raid Boss, Incomplete Fernon. She will be receiving a different buff every 60 seconds.

The blade throwing will no longer be random, but an event that will occur during certain HP intervals (something similar to the Laurena Raid). Blades will be thrown when Fernon has 75/50/25% of her HP. Once the event is triggered both the Broken Krem's Right Blade ![](https://imageshack.com/i/pmPBCuD7p) and the Broken Krem's Left Blade ![](https://imageshack.com/i/pnY4TT8gp) will be thrown. We will have 30 seconds to finish with the blades. During these 30 seconds, Fernon will teleport to the centre of the map and she will receive a buff that will make her immune to any kind of damage and she won't be able to attack or move.

The damage the blades take will be percentage damage (2%), so it will take a total of 50 successful hits to kill one. Blades have a set 75% chance of being hit, giving a slight advantage to magic damage. When the blades are killed, they will give a Buff to the whole team, a Debuff to the Fernon, or both, depending on which of these we remove. The buff and debuff they give are as follows:

The Buff/Debuff will be activated after both blades are destroyed.
In case both blades aren't destroyed in given time, the blade that was killed does its thing, and the raid continues.

## Recommendations for the Raid.
- It is recommended to go with equipment of hero level at least c25 r7-r8+8+9+10.
- Options of shells like: 
	- <font color="#ccff99">S- Increased Damage to High-Level Races: x%</font>
	- <font color="#ccff99">S- Increased Overall Attack: x%</font>
	- <font color="#ffff00">B- Increased Damage to Monster Races: x%</font>
- It is advisable to wear the hats and masks with anti debuff resistances, because the raid has many annoying stuns.
- Within the Raid, it is recommended to focus on the  Broken Krem's Right Blade  ![](https://imageshack.com/i/pmPBCuD7p) first, because the Debuff applied on the Fernon is quite useful to do as much damage as possible during the time it lasts.
- If your team is fast enough to kill both in less than 30 seconds, everyone should focus the nearest blade to not lose time and to optimize raid timer.
- Use the Twilight Gem III Trophy ![](https://imageshack.com/i/pnGxom6Kp) , as resistances reduction is one of the best stats for raiding/PvE (all other major Trophies of each class in tier III are viable for this raid as well).
- Useful partner would be:
	- Amora's Specialist Partner Card ![](https://nosapki.nostale.club/images/Ikona/4103.png). 
	- Freya's Specialist Partner Card ![](https://nosapki.nostale.club/images/Ikona/2575.png)
	- Laurena's Specialist Partner Card ![](https://nosapki.nostale.club/images/Ikona/2709.png)
	- Foxy's Specialist Partner Card ![](https://nosapki.nostale.club/images/Ikona/2672.png)

-   Useful pets would be: 
	- Sick Bushtail ![](https://nosapki.nostale.club/images/Ikona/8158.png)
	- Ninja Bushtail ![](https://nosapki.nostale.club/images/Ikona/8841.png)
	- Fibi Frosty ![](https://nosapki.nostale.club/images/Ikona/8670.png)
## Ideal Raid Group.
Since the Fernon's element is fire, it would be ideal to go with a group with water element SP's (with the exception of debuffers/buffers). The Raid group consists of 8 members, and the recommended SP's are as following:
- **Scout Specialist Card** ![](https://nosapki.nostale.club/images/Ikona/2589.png). Due to its great DPS, the Scout becomes one of the best SP's for this Raid, with the ability to quickly clean the swords with fast hits, and the great damage it can generate to the Fernon with this. It is recommended to have a minimum of four Scouts in your team.
- **Berserker Specialist Card** ![](https://nosapki.nostale.club/images/Ikona/910.png). Due to the great utility it generates within the raid thanks to all the debuffs it can cause, such as  ![](https://nosapki.nostale.club/images/Ikona/10163.png) and ![](https://imageshack.com/i/pmNDo9Tfp). Ideally you should only have one, as you can alternate between Incapacitated and Break Armour to have the Fernon with as little defence as possible.
- **Blue Magician Specialist Card**   ![](https://nosapki.nostale.club/images/Ikona/913.png). *What do you know!* With the recent changes this SP has received, it has become one of the best for this raid, competing almost on a par with the Scout. It is advisable to have 2 or 3 per group in case there is a lack of Scouts. This is due to the following: 
	-   Glacier ![ ](https://imageshack.com/i/poS8VhZ0p) :
	    -   [NEW]  Summons 2x  [Snowball Minion]. Snowball minions are magic mobs that never miss, so they are quite useful to help kill the blades.

	-   Frozen Shield ![](https://imageshack.com/i/pmDt8iFKp) :
	    -   [NEW]  There is a 100% chance of causing  [Forgotten Knowledge], only in Fernon Raid.
