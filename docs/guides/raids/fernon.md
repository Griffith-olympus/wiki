## How can I get the seals?
We have removed the Akashic Record item as a method of entry to the Incomplete Fernon Raid, instead we have added a seal for the raid ![](https://imageshack.com/i/pnEthVI8p). There are three ways to obtain them:
- **Through an achievement:**  You can get 25 seals by completing the one-time Achievement "*Elite Unknown Souls*", which can be found in the **Monsters** section, inside Act 6.2.

- **Killing mobs in the map *Unknown Land*:** All Mobs found within this map will be able to drop a Fernon Raid Seal with some chance.

- **Killing Act 6.2 Mini Bosses:** Throughout some of the maps in *Ancelloan's Will*, you may notice the Mini Bosses, and they may drop a Fernon Raid Seal with a 50% chance.

## Raid Mechanics
You can access the Temple Site through a conversation with Airship Captain in Cylloan. 
Although Fernon entrance is open all the time, you can start raids only within according schedule:

- **Wednesday** 12:30 and 18:30 ST
- **Saturday** 12:30 and 18:30 ST
- **Sunday** 12:30 and 18:30 ST

Which in total gives 6 hours of Fernon raids weekly.

Inside the raid we will find 2 rooms, the second one will open once we activate the lever in the middle of the room ![](https://imageshack.com/i/poeMcLMPp). Once we enter the room, we will meet the Raid Boss, Incomplete Fernon. She will be receiving a different buff every 60 seconds.

Both blades are being thrown each ~10-15 seconds of the raid in random places throughout the map. 
- Broken Krem's Right Blade ![](https://imageshack.com/i/pmPBCuD7p) 
- Broken Krem's Left Blade ![](https://imageshack.com/i/pnY4TT8gp)

We will have less than 10 seconds to pull the blades. If we don't manage to take them in time, they will disappear.
When the blades are pulled, they will apply a buff to the whole team, a debuff to the Fernon, or both, depending on which of these we remove. The buff and debuff they give are as follows:

## Recommendations for the Raid
- It is recommended to go with equipment of hero level at least c25 r7-r8+8+9+10.
- Options of shells like: 
	- <font color="#ccff99">S- Increased Damage to High-Level Races: x%</font>
	- <font color="#ccff99">S- Increased Overall Attack: x%</font>
	- <font color="#ffff00">B- Increased Damage to Monster Races: x%</font>
- It is advisable to wear the hats and masks with anti debuff resistances, because the raid has many annoying stuns.
- Within the Raid, it is recommended to focus mostly on the Broken Krem's Right Blade ![](https://imageshack.com/i/pmPBCuD7p), because the Debuff applied on the Fernon is quite useful to do as much damage as possible during the time it lasts.
- Use the Twilight Gem III Trophy ![](https://imageshack.com/i/pnGxom6Kp) , as resistances reduction is one of the best stats for raiding/PvE (all other major Trophies of each class in tier III are viable for this raid as well).
- Useful partner would be:
	- Freya's Specialist Partner Card ![](https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/2575.png)
	- Barni's Specialist Partner Card ![](https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/2574.png)
	- Amora's Specialist Partner Card ![](https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/4103.png)
	- Laurena's Specialist Partner Card ![](https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/2709.png)
	- Foxy's Specialist Partner Card ![](https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/2672.png)

-   Useful pets would be: 
	- Sick Bushtail ![](https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/8158.png)
	- Fibi Frosty ![](https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/8670.png)
## Ideal Raid Group
Since the Fernon's element is fire, it would be ideal to go with a group with water element SP's (with the exception of debuffers/buffers). The Raid group consists of 8 members, and the recommended SP's are as following:
- **Scout Specialist Card** ![](https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/2589.png). Due to its great DPS, the Scout becomes one of the best SP's for this Raid, with the ability to quickly clean the swords with fast hits, and the great damage it can generate to the Fernon with this. It is recommended to have a minimum of four Scouts in your team.
- **Berserker Specialist Card** ![](https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/910.png). Due to the great utility it generates within the raid thanks to all the debuffs it can cause, such as  ![](https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/10163.png) and ![](https://imageshack.com/i/pmNDo9Tfp). Ideally you should only have one, as you can alternate between Incapacitated and Break Armour to have the Fernon with as little defence as possible.
- **Blue Magician Specialist Card**   ![](https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/913.png). *What do you know!* With the recent changes this SP has received, it has become one of the best for this raid, competing almost on a par with the Scout. It is advisable to have 2 or 3 per group in case there is a lack of Scouts. This is due to the following: 
	-   Glacier ![ ](https://imageshack.com/i/poS8VhZ0p) :
	    -   [NEW]  Summons 2x  [Snowball Minion]. Snowball minions are magic mobs that never miss, so they are quite useful to help kill the blades.

	-   Frozen Shield ![](https://imageshack.com/i/pmDt8iFKp) :
	    -   [NEW]  There is a 100% chance of causing  [Forgotten Knowledge], only in Fernon Raid.
