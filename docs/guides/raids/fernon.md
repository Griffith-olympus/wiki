## How can I get the seals?
We have removed the Akashic Record item as a method of entry to the Incomplete Fernon Raid, instead we have added a seal for the raid ![](https://imageshack.com/i/pnEthVI8p), there are three ways to obtain the seals :
- **Through an achievement:**  You can get 25 seals by completing the Achievement "*Elite Unknown Souls*", which can be found in the **Monsters** section, inside Act 6.2.

- **Killing mobs in the map *Unknown Land*:** All Mobs found within this map will be able to give us with a chance of 2% a Fernon Raid Seal.

- **Killing Act 6.2 Mini Bosses:** Throughout some of the maps in *Ancelloan's Will* you may notice that there are small green dots, these are MiniBosses, which with a 50% chance will give you a Fernon Raid Seal.

## Raid Mechanics
In order to enter in the Fernon Raid path we will have to wait 10 minutes for the end of the Caligor event, once this time has elapsed an entrance to the Temple Site will open, which will be located in ***Citadel***.

Inside the raid we will find 2 rooms, the second one will open once we activate the lever in the middle of the room ![](https://imageshack.com/i/poeMcLMPp).Once we enter the room we will meet the Raid Boss, Incomplete Fernon, she will receive a different buff every 60 seconds.

The blade throwing will no longer be random, it is an event that will occur during certain HP intervals (something similar to the Laurena Raid). Blades will be thrown when Fernon has 90/70/50/30/10% of her HP, basically when each bar is at half. Once the event is triggered both the Broken Krem's Right Blade ![](https://imageshack.com/i/pmPBCuD7p) and the Broken Krem's Left Blade ![](https://imageshack.com/i/pnY4TT8gp)  will drop,   we will have 30 seconds to finish with the blades, during these 30 seconds Fernon will teleport to the centre of the map and she will receive a buff that will make her immune to any kind of damage and she won't be able to attack or move.

The damage the blades take will be percentage damage (1%) so it will take a total of 100 successful hits to kill one. Blades have a 75% chance of being hit, giving a slight advantage to magic damage. When the blades are killed they will give a Buff to the whole team or a Debuff to the Fernon or both depending on which of these we remove, the debuffs they give are as follows:

The Buff/Debuff will be activated after 30 seconds or if both blades are destroyed.

## Recommendations for the Raid.
- It is recommended to go with equipment of hero level c25 r7-r8+8+9+10.
- Options of shells like: 
	- <font color="#ccff99">S- Increased Damage to High-Level Races: x%</font>
	- <font color="#ccff99">S- Increased Overall Attack: x%</font>
	- <font color="#ffff00">B- Increased Damage to Monster Races: x%</font>
- It is advisable to wear the Flower Vase Hat ![](https://nosapki.nostale.club/images/Ikona/346.png) , because it increases damage against High-level Monster by 70.
- Within the Raid, it is recommended to focus on the  Broken Krem's Right Blade  ![](https://imageshack.com/i/pmPBCuD7p) first, because the Debuff applied on the Fernon is quite useful to do as much damage as possible during the time it lasts.
- Use the Twilight Gem III Trophy ![](https://imageshack.com/i/pnGxom6Kp) , as resistances reduction is one of the best stats for raiding/PvE (all other major Trophies of each class in tier III are viable for this raid as well).
- Useful partner would be:
	- Amora's Specialist Partner Card ![](https://nosapki.nostale.club/images/Ikona/4103.png). 
	- Freya's Specialist Partner Card ![](https://nosapki.nostale.club/images/Ikona/2575.png)
	- Laurena's Specialist Partner Card ![](https://nosapki.nostale.club/images/Ikona/2709.png)
	- Foxy's Specialist Partner Card ![](https://nosapki.nostale.club/images/Ikona/2672.png)

-   Useful pets would be: 
	- Sick Bushtail ![](https://nosapki.nostale.club/images/Ikona/8158.png)
	- Ninja Bushtail ![](https://nosapki.nostale.club/images/Ikona/8841.png)
	- Fibi Frosty ![](https://nosapki.nostale.club/images/Ikona/8670.png)
## Ideal Raid Group.
Since the Fernon's element is fire, it would be ideal to go with a group with water element SP's (with the exception of debuffers/buffers). The Raid group consists of 8 members, of which the recommended SP's would be the following:
- **Scout Specialist Card** ![](https://nosapki.nostale.club/images/Ikona/2589.png). Due to its great DPS, the Scout becomes one of the best SP's for this Raid, being able to quickly clean the swords thanks to the ![](https://imageshack.com/i/pmFjiIbap) and the great damage it can generate to the Fernon with this. It is recommended to have a minimum of four Scouts in your team.
- **Berserker Specialist Card** ![](https://nosapki.nostale.club/images/Ikona/910.png). Due to the great utility it generates within the raid thanks to all the debuffs it can cause, such as  ![](https://nosapki.nostale.club/images/Ikona/10163.png) y  ![](https://imageshack.com/i/pmNDo9Tfp).  Ideally you should only have one, as you can alternate between Incapacitated and Break Armour to have the Fernon with as little defence as possible.
- **Blue Magician Specialist Card**   ![](https://nosapki.nostale.club/images/Ikona/913.png). *What do you know!* With the recent changes this SP has received, it has become one of the best for this raid, competing almost on a par with the Scout. It is advisable to have 2 or 3 per group in case there is a lack of Scouts. This is due to the following: 
	-   Glacier ![ ](https://imageshack.com/i/poS8VhZ0p) :
	    -   Cool time: 40s -> 20s
	    -   [NEW]  Summons 2x  [Snowball Minion]. Snowball minions are magic mobs that never miss, so they are quite useful to help kill the blades.

	-   Frozen Shield ![](https://imageshack.com/i/pmDt8iFKp) :
	    -   [NEW]  There is a 100% chance of causing  [Forgotten Knowledge], only in Fernon Raid.
