To be able to continue with the Act6.2 quests, you will first need to have finished the Act6.1 questline.
Using Ancelloan's Blessing is recommended even if you don't get your quests' EXP reward doubled, since you will kill some mobs while you're at it.

## Leveling/Farming and Routes
Act6.2 quests will boosted you from level c30 to level c40 level approximately, after that you will have to farm to reach level c50.
Recommended maps for farming are:

## Recommended SPs

Usually, it is adviced to use SPs opposite to the mobs' element, but there are specialists which can have explosive damage, making them compete in terms of efficiency, with elementally advantageous SPs.

:::tip 
- You can optimize your damage by having Damage to Monster Entities, Damage to Low-Level Entities, and Increased Overall Attack shell options, since most of the mobs in act 6.2 belong to the "Low-level monster" race ![enter image description here](https://imageshack.com/i/pnvoo5jop)
- Amon is still the most useful PSP for farming as there are mobs that hit in range.
- It is recommended to have the Act6.1 hats or the Laurena's Hat, Beast's Golden Horn.
- Rudi Rowdy's buff is the most efficient DPS buff among other pet buffs.
- The quests are very similar to Official, so you can be guided by external sites, such as NosApki, in case you get lost during their course.
