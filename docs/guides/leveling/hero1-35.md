# Champion Leveling Guide C-Lvl. 1-35

## Act6 Questline

The first thing you should be doing when arriving at Level 99 is completing the Act 6.1 questline. It boosts you from Champion Lv. 1 up to around Champion Lv. 10-11. Using Ancelloan's Blessing is recommended, even if you don't get your quest's EXP reward doubled, you will kill a lot of mobs while you're at it. 

While the 6.1 quest line doesn't offer as much experience yet, it opens up the 6.2 quest line which allows you to gather far more EXP. The 6.2 quest line will boost you approximately from Champion Lv. 10-11 to Champion Lv.35 upon completion. You can start the quest line for 6.1 at [Graham] in NosVille & the 6.2 quest line at [Graham] in Cylloan!


Check out the Act 6.1 questline guide for more information [here](https://wiki.olympusgg.com/guides/quests/act-6-questline).

:::tip
- Before you start the quest lines, make sure to properly equip yourself with some Shadow / Light resistances or mixed resistances.
- Do NOT lure bigger amounts of monsters as they can be really tough to deal with, unless you feel comfortable enough to kill them.
- It is recommended working in a party for the "Hunt Quests".
- If you are hunting Zealots for your Quest & don't wanna run across Maps for that ro risk any deaths, try to kill the ones in Heavens Gate 1 entrance and relog inbetween channels to speed it up.
- Raids are being skipped for the most part except for Fernon, which opens only on Wednesday / Saturday / Sunday at 12:30 ST & 18:30 ST for an hour.
- The Items [Coolant](https://wiki.olympusgg.com/drops/items/coolant) & [Lingering Malice](https://wiki.olympusgg.com/drops/items/lingering-malice) can be found in Act 4 Unknown Land as a common drop:

## Act6 - Leveling / Farming

In case you decide not to do the Raids e.g. to make some Gold or gather some Items such as C30 Resistances, you also have the option to grind yourself up in Act 6.1. 
Recommended maps for farming are:

**Hell's Ruins 2**

### General Routes
![Route1](https://i.imgur.com/Cp2DuN5.png) ![Route2](https://i.imgur.com/1MmKniu.png)


:::tip
- Laurena's Witch Hat is what you can use best to your advantage, on both sides.
- Beast's golden horn can be useful if you get stun locked since it reflects and blocks all attacks.
- "Chance of negative effects reduced" is needed if what you want is farm as fast and efficiently as possible, at least on Hellord.
- Make sure you have "reduce critical damage" on accessories to avoid getting struck down as easily.
- Otter can be quite helpful with his voke skill & heal to assisst you in farming monster more conviniently.

## Side Quest

While this option is less viable than the others it can still be useful to gain some small amount of Champion Experience on daily basis.

- The Airship Captain in the top right corner of [Cylloan] has a Side Quest that rewards you with some additional EXP once finished:

    > Reward: 1kk Gold & CXP
