# Combat Level Guide 1-99

## Level 1-85

The easiest, fastest and most efficient way to reach level 85 is always through finishing the full Act 1 questline.

:::tip
- At level 36, you should definitely do the SP1 quest as it will make the rest of the way a lot easier. (Don't upgrade it yet)
- If a quest disappears or isn't completed even though you did it, try to relog. In most cases this will fix it.
- Do not buy the NPC-Buffs from the Wise Druid, since you simply don't need it.
- After finishing all quests you will have a lot of gold (roughly 9kk) - keep in mind that you will need most of it for all the lvl 45 resistances and the raw gold tax for SP3 and SP4 quests.
- Try to always have your pet and partner with you so you don't need to manually level them later on.
:::

### Equip Choices:

Through the quest you will get level-up rewards which contain the necessary equipment pieces to easily progress through Act 1. We recommend the following choices:

_Notes:_

- _Always use the highest level armour you can wear._
- _You don't need shell options for progressing yet._
- _Secondary weapon recommendations are meant as support weapons._

**Archer**:

- **Main**: Red Bow (45lv) &#8594; Bow of Peace (65lv) &#8594; Desert Robbers' Bow(83lv; buy this one from Teoman)
- **Secondary**: Scrammer (44lv) &#8594; Shadow Kris (72lv)

**Swordsman**:

- **Main**: Glorious Sabre (65lv) &#8594; Broken Sword (79lv)
- **Secondary**: Ballista (72lv)

**Mage**:

- **Main**: Red Sage Wand (45lv) &#8594; Soul Wand (63lv) &#8594; Desert Robbers' Walking Stick (83lv) &#8594; Seraphine Wand (85lv)
- **Secondary**: Ray Spell Gun (67lv)

### Quick LoD Info:

- It alternates between channels 2&4 and 3&5 every 2 hours.
- 30 minutes after opening, exp-gain increases significantly and the Fire Devil spawns.

## Level 85-90

This is where the path for the different classes start to split.

You will need to make a decision here whether or not you want to complete the Act 5.1 side questlines or just grind it out in Aster or Rashid maps.

_Note: Mages without extraordinarily good equipment will need to opt for the 5.1 side quests either way, since they won't be able to efficiently clear the Aster/Rashid maps._

Now, let's jump into the benefits and limitations of both possible options.

| Aster/Rashid Farming                          |                                    Act 5.1 questlines                                     |
| :-------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| 4-6h until level 90                           |                                    8h+ until level 90                                     |
| more raw gold gain                            | gold coins for 90lv equipment _(nice to have but also easily obtainable from Ibra Raids)_ |
| semi afk-able                                 |                                 needs some concentration                                  |
| needs Anc. Blessing, Pet Angels and NPC-Buffs |                                        no expenses                                        |

### Aster and Rashid

Wildkeepers (Aster) and Berserkers (Rashid) will have an easy time clearing their respective maps.

#### Tips:

- Stock up on Pet and Partner Guardian Angels, Pots and Snacks before going.
- Do buy the NPC Buffs, they will make you significantly faster.
- After every hour, go back to NosVille to craft snacks (Hamburger/Cheese Sandwiches).
- Set a return point in a spot with a lot of mobs, so you can tp back when they respawn.
- _optional: use tarots (tower/star or sun/devil), fairy boosters and attack pots_

### Act 5.1 Side Quests

On the internet you will find many full lists and [guides](https://nosapki.nostale.club/misje_pustynia) on all possible 5.1 questlines.
Feel free to use these as they are unchanged on this server.

#### Tips:

- Completing every questline will net you a total of 30 gold coins.
- Clearing the kill quests is faster in a group and works globally.
- You don't need to complete every single one, but some are dependent on having completed previous ones.
- You can use Wings of Friendship to quickly get to NosVille and back.
- Set your respawn point to Desert Eagle City.

## Level 90 - 99

From here on out you will need to start optimizing your equipment and start farming in Act 5.2, as well as completing the Act 5.2 main questline.

### Act 5.2 Main Questline

In order to start 5.2 questline, you need to either finish or skip Act4 quests.

This one is fairly easy and I recommend you always complete it as far as you can until you need to wait until someone is hosting a Kertos/Valakus/Grenigas raid in order to progress further. This will give you a decent amount of EXP (enough to get you to at least from level 90 to 93).

### Eastern Path Farming and Tips:

- Split the map into multiple lures.
- Set a return point at the beginning of the map.
- Same expenses as mentioned [above](#aster-and-rashid) in Aster/Rashid.
- Definitely play around your pet and partner to increase survivability.
- From level 97 onwards you can try to transition to farming on Katol's Street but it's quite hard.

### Equipment/SPs:

- You will need complete 90lv equipment (at least r6+7) from here on out.
- Try to get at least some decent shells.
- Farming SPs (Wildkeeper, Blue Mage/Tidelord, Ninja/Battle Monk) should be at least 99+9.
- Opt for at least 80 element skill points with the rest on attack (30/40/50) and hp (rest).
- Preferred Pet and Partner SP is Darko and Aegir on a Kliff _(Craft the 85lv swordsman armour from Teoman into Partner equipment and equip him with 45lv fire res s5)_.
