# Champion Leveling guide 1-30 (Act 6.1)

The first thing you should be doing is completing Act 6.1 questline. It boosts you from Champion Lv. 1 up to around Champion Lv. 10-11. Using Ancelloan's Blessing is recommended, even if you don't get your quest's EXP reward doubled, since you will kill a lot of mobs while you're at it. 
Check Act 6.1 questline guide for more information.

:::tip
- Laurena's Witch Hat is what you can use best to your advantage, on both sides.
- Beast's golden horn can be useful if you get stun locked since it reflects and blocks all attacks, same as with Zenas' Divine Ring 
- "Chance of negative effects reduced" is needed if what you want is farm as fast and efficiently as possible, at least on Hellord.
- Make sure you have "reduce critical damage" on accessories.
- Amon PSP can be very useful since its 3rd skill got changed and can now provoke (extremely useful for seer). For everything else Aegir could be the best option.
