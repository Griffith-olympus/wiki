## **Rotational Random Boxes**

Every week, Olympus Shop will update some of its random boxes.
These rotational random boxes will stay on shop for at least 2 weeks.
Instead of the previous strict rotations system, we will be rotating the random box categories based on players' demand.
It means that some categories might get a new random box every week, while others might not get anything new for a month.
These *Rotational Random Boxes* will stay on shop for at least 2 weeks.
After that, whether they will be removed from rotation or not will be announced with the next rotation plan.
The five categories of Random Boxes that will rotate are:
- Pets
- Vehicles
- Costumes
- [Specialist Wings](/information/wings-rework)
- Partner SP

For more information related to the rotations, you can check [the rotation plans](../shop).
