## **Rotational Random Boxes**

Every week, Olympus Shop will update some of its random boxes.  
These *Rotational Random Boxes* stay on shop for a certain amount of time before getting replaced by another Random Box of the same type.  
There are currently five types of random boxes, and they rotate on different time intervals.

| Box Type                | Update Interval |
|:----------------------- |:--------------- |
| Pet Random Boxes        | Every Week      |
| Vehicle Random Boxes    | Every Two Weeks |
| Costume Random Boxes    | Every Two Weeks |
| Wings Random Boxes      | Every Two Weeks |
| Partner SP Random Boxes | Every Two Weeks |

Remaining types will be introduced later.

For more information related to the rotations, you can check [the rotation plans](../shop).
