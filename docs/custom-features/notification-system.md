# Notification System

## Description

**Notification Center** is brand new Olympus feature. As its name says, it notifies you about various server's activities that are currently happening. 

## How to use?

There are two ways to get into **Notification System**. Either click <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/959421753703161876/960850682259320852/idle.png"/> icon on the top-right next to your map or press K on your keyboard and double-click the same bell icon at the bottom of Motion section.

Once you do that, Notification Center window will show up on your screen. If you have just logged in, there probably won't be any notifications yet. When an action happens, information is going to appear in Notification Center. Once it is there, you can either show more details about it or remove notification by clicking **Hide** button.

This feature also gives an option to send pop-up notifications and show them on right side of your screen when an action occurs. By default, pop-ups are disabled. To turn them on, you need to mark 'Show notification popups' checkbox which is located at the bottom of Notification Center window.
