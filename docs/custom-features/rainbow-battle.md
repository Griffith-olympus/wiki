## Introduction

The rainbow battle is a PvP team based event held multiple times every day. On Olympus, a ranked system has also been introduced, granting monthly rewards to players.

### When does the Rainbow Battle start?

The rainbow battle is held every 2 hours, starting at 01:00:00 Server Time.

### How do I join the Rainbow Battle?

The rainbow battle is only accessible in Channel 1. An icon will appear in the bottom right when the rainbow battle registration begins. Click on it then accept the confirmation prompt to join the rainbow battle.

## How does the Rainbow Battle work?

After registering, players will be split into two teams : Red and Blue. You can see on the scoreboard the current scores of each team, the status of each crystal, the time remaining before the end of battle and your team mates.

After 30 seconds of preparation, the battle starts. Once a team's score reaches 100 points or the time expires the battle ends. In the case of the time expiring, the team with the highest score wins.

### Team bases

Each team has a base. The red team base is located at the bottom left while the blue team base is located at the top right. While in their team's base, players will be healed every few seconds. When a player is killed, they will respawn in their team base after a delay.

### Scoring points

- There are 3 crystals on the map, located at the left, center and right. Capturing a crystal grants 2 to 3 point to the player's team. Holding a crystal grants 2 to 3 points to the team holding it every minute.

- There are two Rainbow Mandras on the map, located at the top left and bottom right from the center crystal. Slaying a Rainbow Mandra grants 3 points to the player's team.

- Killing a player from the enemy team does not grant any point.

The leaderboard lists all players who have participated in the Rainbow Battle. Each page shows 5 players, listing their rank, name, class, wins and losses, kills and deaths, and their total ranked points.

At the bottom there are 4 tabs :  All, Swordsman, Archer and Mage. By default the leaderboard shows players of all classes, however you can choose to only show players of a certain class by clicking on a tab.

You can search for a specific player by entering their name in the search bar at the top left.

By default the leaderboard sorts players by Total Points, which is the sorting used to determine a player's rank and monthly rewards. However you can sort by Win/Loss ratio and Kill/Death count by clicking on the small arrow in the top right.
