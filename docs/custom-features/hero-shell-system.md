Caligor event requires a minimum level of 99(+1), and the maximum number of participants is 400. Upon joining the map where Caligor is, your faction is randomized.

## Schedules
Caligor starts every day at **12:00** and **18:00**. (Server Time)

You can also see how much time has left until next Caligor on Discord's #status channel.
 
## Unknown Land

The mobs of Unknown Land, on top of casual Act4 items, can also drop Perfection Stones, Coolant, Rainbow Pearl, Fernon Raid Seals and Lingering Malice (which we can sell in the NPC for the price of 100.000G).

In addition to this you will find the Mysterious Traveller at the top of the map, which can drop the passive skill books that gives 4000HP and 4000MP.

## Raidbox and Reward

Upon defeating Caligor, all participants with enough contribution points will receive a raid box.
You can get contribution points by dealing damage either to enemies or boss itself.
The Faction that dealt the most damage will receive a **Caligor's Glowing Treasure** and **1x Shell Fragment**, while the other side will receive a **Caligor's Dimming Treasure**.
You have 1 hour to defeat Caligor, otherwise the event will end and no one will receive a reward.

## Heroic Shells
Heroic Shells are an alternative to betting. Caligor raidbox will drop shells with the same rarity as the box, and on top of that, these shells can be recycled to get r8 shell of any type. The shells have the same options to the shell options you get via betting. The shells can only be applied to Heroic Equipment, of any level.

To craft a Heroic Shell, you should visit Crusty Crab which is located at the bottom of Citadel (Act 4).

He can craft Perfect or PvP shells, both weapon and armor. To make a heroic shell, you need a total of 12 Shell Fragments which can be crafted with any heroic shell, regardless of its rarity. To be able to see the options of a shell, you will need to identify it via Rainbow Pearls, which are obtained as a drop from the mobs of Unknown Land.

- Using shells on equipment works the same way as official. You can add the shell on an equipment that already has shell options, in which case, you will fail with 50% chance and lose your shell. 
- To prevent this, you should get Magic Eraser from Malcolm Mix and delete your previous shell. After a shell is carved onto an equipment, it will be bound to the character that bounded the shell. After that, any other character that wants to wear the equipment, they will need to bind it to themselves via Perfumes, which are also sold by Malcolm Mix.
