In order to use the Warp System we will have to go to the **Motion** (K) section, where the other icons such as NosBazaar, Raid List, Time Circle, are located. Once here we can see that a new icon has appeared ![](https://imageshack.com/i/pmd1VrT8p).
To add a new point we must first go to the exact place where we want to save, as the Warp System is really precise. Once there we will have to open the Warp System and go to the gear located at the top right of the window.

Here a small window will pop up which gives you the confirmation to save the point you are at ![](https://imageshack.com/i/pn6WLTZhp).You can save a maximum of five points, which you can change at any time.
To remove a point, simply hover over the gear again and leave your mouse over the location you wish to remove ![](https://imageshack.com/i/pmn0k87hp) . You can also change the order in which the save points are located by moving them between these arrows:
