In order to use the Warp System we will have to either click ![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/959421753703161876/959427777357033512/click.png) icon on the top-right next to our map or go to the bottom of **Motion** (K) section, where the other icons such as NosBazaar, Raid List, Time Circle and emotes are located.

To add a new point we must first go to the exact place where we want to save, as the Warp System is really precise. Once there we will have to open the Warp System and go to the gear located at the top right of the window.

To remove a point, simply hover over the gear again and leave your mouse over the location you wish to remove ![](https://imageshack.com/i/pmn0k87hp) . You can also change the order in which the save points are located by moving them between these arrows:
