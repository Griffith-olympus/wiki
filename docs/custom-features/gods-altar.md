# God's Altar

!["God's Altar"](https://i.imgur.com/XbDi6X7.jpeg)

Feeling lucky? You can offer your gold to the God of Fortune.
If you do, he might give you valuable prizes, if he's pleased with your offer, or he might leave you empty-handed.

When you interact it with it, you will be able to make 3 different offers:
- Offer Gold (1.000.000g) (gives you 1 reward)
- Offer Gold (5.000.000g) (gives you 5 rewards)
- Offer Gold (10.000.000g) (gives you 10 rewards)

Only the number of rewards is affected by the amount of gold offered, not their quality.
