## What is RBB?
Rainbow battle, or RBB for short, is a "tower defence" pvp mode that has been reworked in Olympus to be a more thrilling and rewarding.


## How to enter RBB?
Rainbow battle starts every uneven hour after the IC. The pattern goes like this:  
10:00 IC, 11:00 RBB, 12:00 IC, 13:00 RBB, and so on...
There will be the same alert as there is for IC 5 minutes before it starts.  
When it is time for the RBB you will get a little pop up as you do with the IC on the bottom right corner, it will ask you if you want to participate. After approving you will be entered in a queue which takes 30 seconds at max. For a RBB 6 players are needed since it is a 3v3, players who are left out of multiples of 6 will be left out; e.g 15 players register for RBB there will be 2 RBBs with 6 each so 3 players will not be able to join.


## Gameplay
Each Team starts at their spawn point with all their nosmates, which will not participate in battle but still provide their passive buffs. The map has different points of interest:
1. Big Rainbow crystal, which you can use like a lever and take it for your team, it then generates points every minute for your team.
2. Small Rainbow crystals, same as above but they give less points per minute.
3. Giant Mandra, there are 2 of them on the map. They deal big damage and stun the player but give 5 points when you kill them.

Most of the Fights are around the Big Rainbow crystal, which gives the most points per minute. But don't neglect the small crystals since their points add up too.  
The RBB lasts 10 minutes, and you get points every full minute depending on the amount of Rainbow crystals your team owns.  
If you get killed you will be frozen for a set amount time. Your teammates can unfreeze you, but if not, you will get teleported back to your team's spawn point.
