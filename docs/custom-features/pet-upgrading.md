You can upgrade your pets' attack and defense levels using ![Pet Attack Upgrader](https://imgur.com/0Z8mPxq.png) Pet Attack Upgrader and ![Pet Defense Upgrader](https://imgur.com/mdTp2aH.png) Pet Defense Upgrader sold by **Eva Energy**.

After getting these items for 100k each, you should then click on the pet that you want to upgrade. Using these items by double-clicking on them will attempt to upgrade the pet. 
Failured attempts don't cause the pet any harm.

Upgrading your pet gets progressively harder. While upgrading to +4 is relatively easy, upgrading to +7 may be a challenge if unlucky. Upgrading all the way to +10 is not recommended if you don't have the spare gold.
