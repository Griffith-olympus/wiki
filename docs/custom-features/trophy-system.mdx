import ItemIcon from "../../src/components/itemicon";

## What is a Trophy?
We have redesigned this popular feature which has been requested for a long time. Trophies are new items which will give you different bonuses to your character, you can get them as prizes in raid boxes or through the penalty system after opening 50 boxes of the desired raid.

### Major Trophies

Once you collected 10 minor trophies, you can exchange them for one Major trophy, these can be upgraded two times and their tier will be specified in their name. Upon crafting a major trophy, you get the first tier of it.
To craft the major trophies you must go to Nemo in Nosville and give him the minor trophies he asks for, you can also buy a **Trophy upgrade amulet** ![](https://imageshack.com/i/pnUi7iXwp) for the price of 25.000.000G, which will allow you to upgrade a major trophy. Upgrading a major trophy will improve its bonuses as well as give you new ones.
