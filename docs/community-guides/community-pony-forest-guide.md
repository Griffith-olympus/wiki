## Introduction

Once you reach level 99+30 and start the act 7 main quest, you gain access to spirit forest, the best end game farming map. Most players will spend hours farming gold, items, leveling fairies and selling experience there. Some will optimize and push for the highest monster kills per hour. This guide will try to help all players who wish to farm in spirit forest.

### At what level/When should I start farming?

Once you finish the act 7 main quest and reach level 99+45.

### Where is the Spirit Forest located?

From Olorun Village, go to Woodland Path > Spirit Forest Edge > Spirit Forest.

### Which specialist is the best?

- For archers, the best specialist is Demon Hunter ![](https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/2655.png)
- For swordsmen, the best specialist is Berserker ![](https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/910.png)
- For mages, the best specialist is Seer ![](https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/2656.png)

### Which class is the best?

There isn't a definite answer. Each class has its own pros and cons; the best class is going to be the one you prefer playing as. Demon Hunter, Berserker and Seer are all capable of clearing 2800 monsters in an hour.

## Beginner guide

### Minimum gear

If you do not meet these requirements you should farm in act 5.2 or do other activities to gain gold and buy what you need.

- Mask : While X Mask is not technically required, there is no better and cheaper item that you can use at this stage.
- Hat : Use Cowboy Hat for archers and swordsmen, Monkey Hat for mages.
- Fairy : While expensive at this stage, a Grown Turik is worth the cost as it is already at 40% and can level up to 70%. A regular Shadow Fairy, most likely at 0% is a severe loss of damage.
- Main and secondary weapons : Fernon weapons are cheaper and stronger than Heavenly/Hellord weapons which makes them the best choice. Buy whatever is cheapest, investing in a strong shell is not worth the cost. Upgrade your main weapon to rarity 5+7 at a minimum. Archers will also need to upgrade their dagger.
- Specialist : Demon Hunter and Seer can be traded for 50 Mystic Gemstone at NPC Lilith in Port Alveus Square, which you can buy in the NosBazaar. Berserker is obtained by completing the SP4 quest line. You should upgrade your specialist to +10 or higher.
- Resistances : Buy Shining Battle Gauntlets and Shining Wind Boots at Teoman Topp then make a Sum 5 of each at Malcolm Mix.
- Armor : Keep the level 90 armor you gained while leveling.
- Accessories : Keep the Rudiselrun accessories you gained while leveling. If you forgot, give them options at Soraya Style.
- Costume : Make sure you equipped the free permanent bear costume you gained early on while leveling.

### Partner and Pet

- For your partner, use Kliff. Buy a sword and swordsman armor at Teoman Topp then convert it to partner equipment and give it to Kliff.
- For your pet buy a Viking Bushi as it is the cheapest pet with a 5% damage buff. Do not forget to give it special pet food as it increases its speed and allows it to pick up items.

### Title

As damage is very low at this stage, you need to equip the Hunter title. You unlock it while leveling and it gives a 10% damage increase against all monsters in spirit forest.

### Important items

- Infinite versions of Wing of Return, Amulet of Return and Bell of Sweet Home : Very useful since you won't ever need to buy them again, and are used a lot as you will see below. You can trade them for 999 of the regular version at Malcolm Mix. Infinite Wing of Return is not technically needed as you will rarely use it.
- NosMate Guardian Angel and Partner's Guardian Angel : Lets your pets respawn instantly, make sure you always have a few hundreds in your inventory.
- Fairy Booster : Significant damage boost for one hour at a cheap cost.
- Divine Recovery Potion : Instantly refills all your HP and MP. Becomes basically free after some time spent farming. Crafted with Fresh Moss at the Supermarket in Olorun.
- Alchemist's Beverage : 10 Minutes Attack Potion, Defence Potion and Energy Potion in one. Becomes basically free after some time spent farming. Crafted with Juice Meat at the Supermarket in Olorun.
- Tarot Cards : Use Fool, Devil, Sun or Star while leveling. Usually more expensive than fairy boosters but last for 3 hours.

### Point of return and Personal warp setup

Before you start farming you need to setup your point of return. This is done by using a Wing of Return and clicking Confirm when asked to save your position. You want to set it in the bottom right corner of the map. Also, since you will often come back to farm in spirit forest you will want to add a personal warp here.

### Enemies

In Spirit Forest there are 5 different enemies :

![](https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/monsters/3013.png)

Moss Gloop (Water) - Very weak enemy but also the most dangerous because of its debuff. When attacking it has a 2% chance to inflict Glue for 15 seconds, which reduces your speed by 50%. Because of the extreme speed reduction, receiving this debuff is really bad. Can drop x1 Spirit Forest Branch (100k)

![](https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/monsters/3015.png)

Rock Golem (Water) - They have a 1% chance to stun you for 2 seconds. Can drop x2 Golem Core (100k)

![](https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/monsters/3014.png)

Moss Fairy (Water) - Weak enemy. Can drop x2 Spirit Forest Branch (100k)

![](https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/monsters/3011.png)

Guardian Spirit (Light) - When being attacked, they have a 50% chance to reduce the damage by 50%. This makes them much tankier than the other enemies and they are the reason a Dark element specialist is needed to farm here. Can drop x1 Golem Core (100k)

![](https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/monsters/3011.png)

Spirit King's Messenger (Light) - A stronger and tankier version of Guardian Spirit. There is only one on the map located in the top left. Its respawn time is much longer than the other enemies, meaning it will only be present every other lure.

### Pathing and Lures

![](https://cdn.olympusgg.com/images/minimaps/2636.png)

We are going to do 4 different lures. The map is naturally split into 3 parts by bridges, and at the top right there is a sharp turn which delimits the third and fourth lure. This looks like so :

![](https://imgur.com/rbzPJ1d.png)

Once you have cleared lure 4, use your amulet of return to teleport back to lure 1 and repeat.

Note : when luring with your pets it is common for them to get stunned or slowed which will split your lure. Pay attention to where your pets are before you start killing the lure.

### Pre-entering Rift buff sequence

Before you enter the rift and start farming, you need to get all your buffs outside the rift as you can't use the bell of sweet home from inside the rift. A rift lasts for 60 minutes so you want all your buffs to end at the same time.

First go next to the rift and use the bell of sweet home. In your miniland use 6 Alchemist's Beverage, which will stack to 60 minutes, then a Fairy Booster. Talk to the Phantom Druid NPC > Receive a buff > Hero's Greater Blessing. Finally exit your miniland, talk to the Mysterious Rift NPC > Enter Alone or Enter with Party.

### Sound Flower's Blessing

Sound Flower's Blessing is gained after completing a Sound Flower quest, which you get when picking up a Sound Flower, and lasts 10 minutes. It is the strongest damage buff in the game, as it not only guarantees a soft crit with every hit, it also gives +10% soft crit damage. In Spirit Forest, Sound Flowers have a 3% chance to drop, which means usually you will get one within 4 lures, after which you will always have it active. Until you get your first flower you may struggle to clear lures.
