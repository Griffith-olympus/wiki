Changelog of 01/11/2021 maintenance.
<!--truncate-->
### QoL
- Wing of Return will now work on Pocket Dimensions. You'll be teleported at the entrance of the pocket dimension when used and it will save your return point using the map coordinates, not the pocket dimension itself.
- Some additions in #maintenances, #act4-dungeons, #instant-battle, #rainbow-battle.
- Removed all banking fees.

### Bug fixing
- Launcher should have less errors but it's not yet completely fixed. We are checking with Cloudflare why it occurs that often.
- Aegir now works as it should.
- Fixed huge damage visuals at Namaju.
- Fixed common materials' description.
- Fixed Ancient Scripts' bcards.
