# Changes
- Made Fernon portal permanently visible to avoid confusion.
- Fernon Raid Seal can now be used even when Fernon raid is closed so teams can prepare in advance. 
- Changed required level for Event Achievements from 80 to 95 due to mass abuse.
- Readjusted Laurena's Accessories to have damage modifiers instead of PvP bonuses.
- Changed Yuna the Magic Student's buff Heart Pound to heal in flat amounts instead of percentage:
  - Every 4 seconds: 2/3/4/5/6/7/10% -> (3/5/8/10/12/15/25 x Partner Level) HP is recovered.

# Bug fixes
- Fixed pet buffs being removed when removing a PSP.
- Fixed Mysterious Eggs being able to get buffs that would increase their maximum HP.
- Fixed gold shells and gold increasing effects not working with autoloot in solo rifts. 
- Fixed pets & partners being able to attack a target while it's jumping (Lord Draco, Chicken King, etc.)
- Fixed pets & partners being able to attack their own factions' guardians.
- Fixed summoned monsters like Onyx causing instant death in Ice Breaker.
