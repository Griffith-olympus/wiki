It\'ll bring you to Lv.90 by its end.\\nAfter completing Part1, Part2 quests can be obtained from Ragnar at the entrance of Rock Cliff.\\nFinishing Valhalla Part2 and Act5.2 questlines will bring you near 99Lv.\\nThese quests are mainly an alternative for new players to level up solo without having to farm in Act5.2 or LoD. You\'ll still need to farm though, to get enough resources to build a character.\\n\\nFafnir Raid & achievements have been implemented.\\nKey to Fafnir\'s Castle can be bought from the Mysterious Monk in NosVille or can be dropped by the monsters in Midgard just north of Maple Woods.\\nRaid entrance is on the Castle Aria Int. map, near Midgard.\\nIn the raidbox, you can find divine fairies, fairy essences, Viking costumes, and even an Unidentified Egg that randomly turns into Zenas or Erenia\'s Egg.\\nAs a percentage raid, the raid is made fast and easy. Consequently, the chance for rare loots mentioned above had to be kept low.\\nIt also contains Fafnir\'s Fried Dinner which can be used to cleanse Lv.3 and lower debuffs in all sorts of situations.\\nAll things considered, we think it\'s worthy to do some Fafnir maras for an easy flow of direct gold if not for all the rare loot.\\n\\n## SP Changes\\n\\nYou can access the changelog for SPs here: <a href=\\"https://wiki.olympusgg.com/release-reworks/act7-sp-changelog\\">Click</a><br /><br />"},{"id":"2022-06-26-changelog","metadata":{"permalink":"/changelogs/2022-06-26-changelog","source":"@site/changelogs/2022-06-26-changelog.md","title":"Changelog -
